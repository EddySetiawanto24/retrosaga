## Architecture Overview

RetroSaga's architecture is built around three core components:

### NLink

NLink serves as the communication backbone of the engine. It allows different modules to interact seamlessly, ensuring that all components work together efficiently.

### PolyBuild

PolyBuild orchestrates the build process, managing dependencies and optimizing the compilation of your game assets. This systematic approach ensures that you get faster build times and a more streamlined workflow.

### RetroSaga

At the heart of the engine lies RetroSaga itself. This is where the core game logic resides, along with rendering and input handling. The engine is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing developers to extend its capabilities as needed.

## Supported Platforms

RetroSaga supports a variety of platforms, including:

- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

This cross-platform capability ensures that you can develop and deploy your games on multiple devices without major changes to your codebase.

## Usage

After installation, you can start creating your game projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

1. Create a new project folder.
2. Inside the folder, create a file named `main.cpp`:

   ```cpp
   #include <retrosaga.h>

   int main() {
       RetroSaga::init();
       RetroSaga::run();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. Compile the project using the following command:
